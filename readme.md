# Prairie Project : Tech blog with WordPress

## Presentation  
We had to create a classic html/css website looking like a blog, then we needed to create a Wordpress  
theme using this site going from a full html page to multiple .php files.

## What's inside  
_header.php_ : all of <head> and <header>  
_footer.php_ : contains <footer> and scripts (mostly onload functions) also closes the <body>  
_content.php_ : the main structure of all posts  
_index.php_ : includes all previous .php files and loops to display articles  

_css/main.css_ : css done by hand (rest in bootstrap.css)  
_js/main.js_ : all custom made functions

## How ?  
we were supposed to create a few js functions and include them in an html page, then turn it in  
a Wordpress theme.
