  <h4>By Blog Tech</h4>
  <p class="categories">Software</p>
  <p class="articleP card-text">Google has announced the launch of the first reCAPTCHA Android API as part of Google Play Services, aiming to better tell humans and bots apart on mobile.<br>The older versions of reCAPTCHA have been refined to create a version that can provide
    interruption-free, streamlined user experience – the Invisible reCAPTCHA in March 2017 – which means users can go through sites automatically. The API will utilise the newest Invisible reCAPTCHA technology, with it also being included with
    Google SafetyNet, which enables mobile developers to perform device and user attestations in the same API to tackle security risks of their apps more efficiently. This enhances the protection capabilities of Google Play Protect to monitor
    for potentially harmful applications, device encryption, and regular security updates.<br>“The journey of reCAPTCHA continues: we’ll make the Internet safer and easier to use for everyone (except bots),” wrote Wei Liu, product manager.</p>

    <br>“People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing. He added, “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing.
    We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.”
    <br>Most of this growth has been driven by the ‘Gaming’ and ‘Entertainment’ categories.</p>

  <h4>By Blog Tech</h4>

  <p class="articleP card-text">Google made several big VR announcements during its annual I/O developer conference including the launch of new tools which aim to further improve the quality of content.
    <br>The VR industry has matured significantly over the past year – so much that BAFTA has rightly begun recognising some of the best examples alongside its renowned awards for film and TV. But for every good example, if we’re honest, there
    are more terrible examples as designers and developers get to grips with this relatively new category.
    <br>Google plans on making VR development easier while also improving the quality of content in a variety of ways. The first is with an ‘Instant Preview’ feature which reduces the amount of time (and subsequent frustration) it takes for a
    developer to preview changes made to their code.</p>

  <h4>By Blog Tech</h4>
  <p class="categories">Dev Software</p>
  <p class="articleP card-text">IFTTT has become invaluable for connecting various products and services together, but it was limited to its large partners in the past. Today, however, the platform is opening its virtual doors to individual developers to build and publish
    applets for anyone. For those uninitiated, IFTTT (If This Then That) allows people to create ‘recipes’ which help to maximise the potential of products and services. For example, a high carbon dioxide level detected by a Netatmo Weather Station
    at home could result in your Phillips Hue lights blinking a few times or altering colour to remind you to open a window.
    <br>"Makers will be able to publish and show off their creations on dedicated profile pages."
    <br>Last August, IFTTT announced it would allow third-party companies to build their own apps and services using the IFTTT partner platform. The initial partners included Adobe and smart doorbell manufacturer Ring. More recently, Dominos jumped
    on board to have smart home devices such as Hue lights update customers on the progress of their pizza delivery.</p>

    <br>Stack Overflow has also launched Stack Overflow Trends, a tool to analyse ongoing and past trends in developer activities in mobile-related technologies. It has learned that Android was the most discussed topic on their platform after

    <br>With increasing competition also heating up from the likes of Microsoft, Baidu, and Apple, it’s clear the race to become a leader in AI is heating up. Today’s announcement offers a cheap method for the more than 12.5 million Raspberry
    Pi owners to get started with building smart devices which utilise Google’s AI.</p>

    “GameCredits strives to provide game developers and gamers with a mutually beneficial solution they equally deserve,” the company notes on its API page.
    <br>The company claims that developers who go down their route can increase revenue by 20%, eliminate chargebacks, and open up various new geographical areas for payment. GameCredits partnered with Datcroft in November, and adds that after

    <br>The founder and long-time principal developer of Linux never minces his words. In the past, Torvald’s been called out for ‘verbally abusing’ his programmers with expletive-ridden language, and in response, has said: “I'm not going to start
    wearing ties, I'm also not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics, and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what 'acting professionally' results in.”
    <br>With the first release candidate of Linux 4.11 now available, Torvalds took some time to vent some frustration at the quality of some code he received as part of the merge process. Some of the code he received would not even build, he
    claims, and developers were not adhering to Linux’s standard development processes.</p>
